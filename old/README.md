# KjscePing

A C program to simulate the working of a network tool "Ping". The project was aimed at designing a custom command which works the same way as Ping. The project however can only simulate two of the original Ping functionalities.

This project was done to fulfil the partial requirements for the completion of the course "Network Programming Laboratory".
